					{`Carpalar’s main product is her ‘Drive-to-own’ service. Our
					utmost goal is to create ownership opportunities to
					individuals who are interested in securing automobiles for
					personal or business purposes but are financially incapable.
					Our brand’s identity differs uniquely as consumers of our
					product are expected to pay just an affordable percentage of
					the fleet vehicle value before commencing usage of vehicle.
					After the initial payment, the remaining payment is spread
					across a stipulated period as agreed between our company and
					the customer. Upon payment completion, the customer becomes
					entitled to the ownership of the vehicle. However, a
					customer is also permitted to opt for early settlement of
					repayment period.`}
